    <p>The <b>chicken</b> (Gallus gallus domesticus) is a type of domesticated fowl, a subspecies of the red junglefowl
        (Gallus gallus). Chickens are one of the most common and widespread domestic animals, with a total population of
        23.7 billion as of 2018.[1] up from more than 19 billion in 2011.[2] There are more chickens in the world than
        any other bird or domesticated <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fowl">fowl.</a>[2] Humans keep chickens
        primarily as a source of food (consuming both their
        meat
        and eggs) and, less commonly, as pets. Originally raised for cockfighting or for special ceremonies, chickens
        were not
        kept for food until the Hellenistic period (4thâ€“2nd centuries BC).[3][4]</p>

    <p>Genetic studies have pointed to multiple maternal origins in South Asia, Southeast Asia, and East Asia,[5] but
        with the clade found in the Americas, Europe, the Middle East and Africa originating in the Indian subcontinent.
        From ancient India, the domesticated chicken spread to Lydia in western Asia Minor, and to Greece by the 5th
        century
        BC.[6] Fowl had been known in Egypt since the mid-15th century BC, with the "bird that gives birth every day"
        having
        come to Egypt from the land between Syria and Shinar, Babylonia, according to the annals of Thutmose
        III.[7][8][9]
